# FGO-Duel
INCOMPLETE. Everything is figured out and started to be implemented. There is still alot of data entry, styling, and optimizing of the unorganized mess of code needed to have it in working order. If you do not know the rules for the game the rules are on the official site at https://duel.fate-go.us/how_to_play/. A work in progress video game for the Fate Grand Order Duel trading card/figure/board game. Basically works by adding and removing classes, changing variables, and changing arrays based the selected units, units skills, board state, combat results, turns, turn phases, and cards drawn then changing what happens based on the simultaneous state of those many elements.
